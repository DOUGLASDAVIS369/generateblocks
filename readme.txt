Meet FlexBlocks, a small collection of lightweight WordPress blocks that can accomplish nearly anything.

== Description ==

FlexBlocks isn't your average block plugin with 30+ half-baked blocks. Instead, we've created 4 powerful blocks that can be used to create nearly anything.

The combination of our Container, Grid, Headline and Buttons block can be used to build almost any layout you can think of. We're serious about performance - FlexBlocks only adds CSS that's necessary for your content, and doesn't add any additional resources.

FlexBlocks is currently in beta, please bare with us as we work through any bugs.

== Installation ==

There's two ways to install FlexBlocks.

1. Go to "Plugins > Add New" in your Dashboard and search for: FlexBlocks
2. Download the .zip from WordPress.org, and upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory via FTP.

In most cases, #1 will work fine and is way easier.
